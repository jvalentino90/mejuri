## Wallet
On localhost:XXXX/cc_test.png (public/cc_test.png) you'll find a picture which describes a basic wallet. This wallet consists in adding N Credit card numbers to a list. 
The actions are:
- Click on add a new card, it'll show 3 empty fields (to enter the Credit card number,CVV and expiration date) and a save button. The new number should be stored when the user click on the "Save" button.
- Each credit card on the list will have an X, in order to remove an item when it's needed.
- It's not possible to edit the items. 

### Notes
The look and feel of the wallet is up to you, the image is only a guidance. 
This is an empty Rails 4.2.7 project.
